<!-- BOT REQUIREMENTS -->

## Bot Requirements

You need to be logged in in order to use the app. You can select login with Google or Facebook or just create an account on our platform (better to say â€¦or sign up with email?). After you logged in you can start using the app.

<!-- BOT CONFIGURATION -->

## Bot Configuration

- Exchanges field. List of available exchanges.
- Set Custom Node button. A method to change the default Node URL.
- Gas Price field. You can set the gas price based of your preferences. For Ethereum network (Uniswap) refer to [current gas price](https://etherscan.io/gastracker). For BSC Network (PancakeSwap) 5 GWEI is the minimum gas price, you can set as much as you prefer.
- Gas Limit field. You can set the gas limit for each buy & sell transaction based on your preferences. The default gas limit is 178198 and you can leave it as it is.
- Add New Wallet button. You can add a wallet using a private key or a JSON Keystore wallet with password. Your private key is encrypted and saved locally on the app. The wallet can be used later for each token pair.
- Wrap ETH/BNB to WETH/WBNB button. A function to wrap/convert from ETH/BNB to WETH/WBNB.
- Wrap WETH/WBNB to ETH/BNB button. A function to wrap/convert from ETH/BNB to WETH/WBNB.
- Add New Token. To add new token, you need the Contract Address of the token. You can also select the wallet for each token list.
- Check Tokens Approval. A function to check the tokens approval with the exchange router contract address.

<!-- HOE THRE BOT WORKS? -->

## How the bot works

The bot will check the tokens price every five seconds. If the price is within the range of Buy At value then the bot will execute the buy order. The bot will use all available WETH/WBNB balance in the wallet that associated with the token list to buy the token. It is better to use different wallet for each token list. After the bot is successfully buy the token, it will keep checking the sell price range. It will sell all of the token amount from the wallet.

If the price is equal or below the stop-loss value, it will sell all of your token back to WETH/WBNB.

<!-- DO WE CHANGE -->

## Do we need change the default node?

It depends. We are providing the default node for you to use. But there is always a chance that our default node will be down or not accessible. If that happened and you have a node from a third party service such Infura or QuickNode, you can use it. Or you can use any available public node. You can get BSC public node from [here](https://docs.binance.org/smart-chain/developer/rpc.html) and Ethereum node from [Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/distributed-web/ethereum-gateway/getting-started) .

<!-- IS KEY SAFE! -->

## Is my private key safe?

Yes of course. Your private key is encrypted on the app and we never have access to the private key. This is how to [export your private key](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-Export-an-Account-Private-Key)

<!-- MULTIPLE INSTANCE -->

## Can I run multiple instances of the bot on my computer?

Yes, all you need is to reopen the app and it will display new window.
This is helpful if you want to trade multiple DEXs at the same time i.e. Uniswap and PancakeSwap (additional DEXs to be added soon!).
